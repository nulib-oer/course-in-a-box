## Create an open textbook

This toolkit will help you use GitHub to build and publish an open textbook online **for free**. No installation of software or experience with programming is required, but we'll be using some software development terminology and doing some plain-text editing in the browser. 

The content will primarily be written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and hosted on [Github](https://www.github.com), a popular development platform that allows for collaborative drafting, version control, and easy dissemination of your textbook.

## What is an open textbook?

An open textbook is free textbook that can be distributed online without payment or permission in order to maximize the access and usability of the learning materials. Open textbooks are distributed under an open copyright license, like [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/). They are part of a larger category of teaching materials called [open educational resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources).

## What you'll be able to do

- Write your textbook in Microsoft Word, Markdown, or LaTeX
- Publish your textbook in HTML, PDF, and EPUB formats
- Learn the basics of [minimal computing](https://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/about/)
