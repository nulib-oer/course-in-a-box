## Create an Open Textbook

This toolkit will help you use GitHub to build and publish an open textbook online **for free**. No installation of software or experience with programming is required, but we'll be using some software development terminology and doing some plain-text editing in the browser. 

The content will primarily be written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and hosted on [Github](https://www.github.com), a popular development platform that allows for collaborative drafting, version control, and easy dissemination of your textbook.

## What you'll be able to do

- Write your textbook in Microsoft Word, Markdown, or LaTeX
- Publish your textbook in HTML, PDF, and EPUB formats
- Learn the basics of [minimal computing](https://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/about/)
